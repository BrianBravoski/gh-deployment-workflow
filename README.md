# gh-deployment-workflow
Roadmap GitHub Actions project

- This follows the roadmap project [Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-actions-deployment-workflow)
- The steps followed were 
    1. Create a GitHub repository for the project called gh-deployment-workflow for example.
    2. Repository should contain a simple index.html file saying “Hello, GitHub Actions!”
    It should also have a README.md file explaining the project.
    3. There should also be a deploy.yml file in the .github/workflows directory which contains the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the website to GitHub Pages.
    4. Every push to the main branch that changes the index.html file should trigger the workflow to run and deploy the website to GitHub Pages.
    5. Website and any changes you make should be accessible at the GitHub pages URL for the repository e.g. https://<username>.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/.
